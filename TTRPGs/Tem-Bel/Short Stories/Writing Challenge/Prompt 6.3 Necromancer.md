# Story

  

She was sitting at the window. Looking out into the wet streets outside. Lying comfortable on a straw mattress, I watched her. It was one of those rare quiet moments in our lives. Usually we had a businesses to run, people to look after. Usually we had to accommodate whatever moments of shared peace we had, around our schedules. Usually though, was not today, or tonight to be precise. The occasional lightning strike illuminated her silhouette in irregular intervals. Flashing her amiable features into my mind. I treasured each as if they were paintings. Her sitting there like the gods had spawned her into the world. A ridiculous thought, since to me she could just as easily take place among them. Blessed with wisdom beyond her years and a countenance no painting could do justice, she would fit well among the other depictions of heavenly beings. In me she certainly had a believer, if she ever would try that particular idea. It was warm outside, even though it rained. Back when I first came here I hated it. Wondered what hatred the gods must have felt for the inhabitants of this desolate kettle of a valley. Now I was not complaining any more. Even during the winter months you had no use for garments during the night. Flash after flash illuminated the room. Painting her into a slight shimmer, from the last few remnants of sweat glistening on her curves. The smell of fresh rain filled the room. Mixing with the notes of mint and incense she liked to cover herself with. There was no reason for any of us two to move right now. We’d be moving soon enough anyway. Sun would be setting in an hour or two, workers and clients would be waiting outside. Demanding our attention or asking for visitations. It was the thing keeping us afloat after all. Affording us to live opportunities like tonight. Living our dreams. It wasn’t perfect. It was not and probably never will be. But such is life. Another flash burned into my eyes. I can live with that. Seeing what waited for me at the window, I could definitely live with that.
