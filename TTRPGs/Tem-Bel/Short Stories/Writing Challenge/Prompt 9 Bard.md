My dear sweetheart,

  
  

it befalls to me, your heart's second half, to inform you of things which have yet to happen to me. Once this simple letter chances upon you, my life shall be no more. I wonder, as I am writing these, whether you will receive them, during the shine of a warm summer's day, or while reading at your library, harsh blizzard shaking the glassy windows from outside. I hope you are seated, my dearest lily, for it would sicken me to think, that my demise caused you to faint and hurt yourself! That with my last breath, I shalt condemn the only warmth in these days to pain and injury. Things are not go The circumstances of my writing are dire. Writing these, my hands are rocked hither and thither, by the base curs which assault our holding. Their damned monsters of war, ravishing the castle's walls, wailing for entrance, so that their cruel masf masters may charge and slaughter us whole! Death alone would laugh at their plight, for if they knew, that almost none were left, they'd surely despair. Distraught at the pain, of wasting resources. Perturbed at a slaughter lost to ambition.

Open arms raised high. Holding you tight until the end of time. For when we meet, in the great immaterial plane, we shall never be torn apart again! Freshly baked cake shall await you. Baked in our very own house. Equipped with cushioned seats and warm fire. With solid roof and silken bedding. Until you arrive, I shall toil and work for you. Working to redeem my absence from your life. For it is a tragedy, encountered not even in the grandest of theatres. Instead, it is found, in this lowest of cellars. Rocketing from hrut left to right, at the behest of primitive spirits. A malignant force. Foul and unworthy, to rip me from your side. I count the seconds, to my death. I count them with the restless dead roaming the catacombs. For until it is done, my pain will never subside. But be assured, if this letter were to ever reach your tender hands, my pain is gone. For rest assured, that I will be waiting. Waiting for you to come. Waiting to tel-
