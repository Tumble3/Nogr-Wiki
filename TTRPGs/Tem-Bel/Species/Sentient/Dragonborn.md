## Quick Facts

Dragonborn are imposing figures, due to their hard scales and fire breath. While they may only reach an average height of 6 feet, their bodies can pack enough muscle and organs in there to easily weigh as much as two average humans. Dragonborn have only one biological gender, owing to the fact that they do not need to transfer physical media between each other. Their society is deeply intertwined with the Kobolds. They live in a symbiotic relationship with them, where the Dragonborn will provide hands on labour due to their natural skill in anything physical forming a symbiotic relationship with the more esotherical Kobolds. While Dragonborn may be more generally suited to menial tasks this does not mean, that they are unable to perform great feats in the arts. Infact owing to their hands-on mindedness, Dragonborn artistry is one favoured in many a noble's halls. Some of the world's most renowned painters came from [[Ma'antur]], the country which both Kobolds and Dragonborn equally call their home. Dragonborns may not be the most eloquent of the sentient races, but this does not mean their music can not be rich and intense. A Dragonborn folk song can incorporate many different topics and stylistic choices, ranging from a simple worker's song to pass the time during repetitive labour, to hour long recitals to a love lost or a brave hero. While it may lack the poetic refinement of their Kobold brethren, a Dragonborn bard's performance will still be able to tug on the many strings of a persons existence.

## Culture

Due to the Dragonborns' natural affinity for menial tasks, the Dragonborns' culture is strongly centred around the pride in one's work and a focus around the betterment of the community as a whole. In Turian society there is no "useless" or "undesireable" role, since each member of the community fulfills an important task towards the betterment of the group. This can be observed in the way things are constructed. Whereas in other places people may see a house as just another building needed to provide shelter, or as a place for people to work in, a Turian architect will see each new building as an opportunity to create the best building possible. Turian architecture is built to last. In the older parts of towns there are buildings, centuries old, looking as if they were built yesterday. No Turian home would be considered "complete" until each stone was engraved by the mason creating it, each wooden support be polished and prepared to perfection, and outside as well as inside walls be painted in vibrant colours, depicting stories out of the Great Dragon Mythology or just everyday scenes picked from the time the painting was done.  

Turian society has many different festivals and occasions calling for celebrations. 

### Child birth

The birth of a child is usually cause for the whole village to organise a day long celebration in order to assure the child's continued welfare. As it is believed that if a child's first day on this plane is spent in happiness, the rest of its life will follow this example. In larger cities this custom had to be curtailed somewhat due to the high likelihood of a child being born every day. Instead of the whole town celebrating one child's birthday, it was decided through necessity that parents would form a group of all delivered children that day and invite their kin, friends and neighbours to spent the day together instead. Reason here is that shared happiness confounds and thus should alleviate any bad luck coming from the rest of the town missing the occasion. 

### Harvest Season

At both the beginning and the end of the harvest season, a community regardless of size, will host a day long celebration. This is both in order to thank the Great Dragons for another harvesting season but also in order to celebrate the group's efforts in providing abundant sustenance for everyone. Depending on region and the specific season, this day may see exuberant amounts of wine and bread being consumed, whereas a different region may indulge in mead and pie. Customs vary wildly between each community almost as much as their dialects. 


### Regional Holidays

Due to the largely decentralised religious structure of the [[The Great Dragons|Great Dragon Mythology]] each community has slightly differing days for their religious celebrations. While many share the same days or causes for celebration there is generally speaking no community who aligns one to one with another on when to celebrate what. 


### Rite of passage

In order to show their peers that they are ready to become a full adult a Dragonborn cub will have to go through several ritualistic steps: 

#### Show of Wisdom

Once the Cub decides it is time for them, they will have to come to their community forum in order to be queried by anyone present in any matter. There is no standardised format for this test, instead the Cub will have to prepare for the unique challenges and issues present at the time in their region. Since each community has a strong sense of belonging and individuality a standardised test would be impossible to conceptualise. Since there is no exact telling what the Cub will be questioned on, they will have to prove their ability to improvise as well as their general knowledge on matters relevant in the eyes of the community.  
In villages such a questioning will involve everyone and will be treated more like a celebratory day, were everyone will gather and celebrate the Cub's first step into adulthood.  
In cities this works a little different. Since cities are large centres of population children are usually grouped together into batches of 3, 5 or 7 individuals, depending on the amount willing to start their trial. Instead of the whole city coming to their questioning, they will instead enter each of the local temples and be presented with a individual singular question. Depending on the size of the city and amount of temples, some communities decide whether having the cubs visit multiple temples to the same deity is necessary or if one temple per deity suffices. 

#### Show of skill

Depending on the Cub's personal preferences, in the second stage, the Cub will have to show off their abilities for creation. They will choose a project which will show off their prowess in their interests. Some cubs may choose to dedicate their efforts into showing off their expertise at carving stone, wood or metal, while others may create a massive painting and another one may compose their musical magnum opus. But the Cub will not be limited to expressing themselves through just one medium, if the Cub decides they want to create a multi faceted representation of their skills, involving multiple arts and crafts, then they are welcome to do so.  
In the end it matters not how someone created but that someone created, valuing their heart and soul put into it instead of the end result on its own. 

#### Show of strength

In order to show their ability to provide for their eventual offspring and the other members of their community the Cub will have to show off their physical strength and health. The Cub will have to pick up and carry the community's Adulting Stone and make one full circle around the village's outer borders. In cities the Cub would only need to make a tour around their borough instead of the whole city. 

#### Celebration of Adulthood

Once all the trials are completed the Cub will be welcomed into the community as a full adult. As a full adult it is now possible for them to choose a partner and produce offspring. They will also be able to start their own enterprise or seek full employment in someone else's. They will now be a full part of all the privileges and requirements expected and provided to them by the community. 



## Language

The Turian language has two major varieties: 
1. Standard Turian (colloquially called "City Turian")
2. Turian Dialect (colloquially called "Viallge Turian")

Standard Turian is the Turian taught in Temple schools and used in official politics, not because it is superior in any way to the Turian dialects but because it is standardised and thus easier for foreigners to learn and makes communication between distant communites easier.  

Turian Dialect is the umbrella term for any of the countless Turian Dialects found among Turian communities. Due to the strong sense of community shared between all Turians, villages, towns and even large cities will have their own dialect. Depending on frequency of exchange with different communities, such dialects may or may not deviate more or less strongly from the Standard Turian or their neighbouring deviations. Generally it can be surmised that a Turian from one corner of the region will have a hard time understanding another Turian coming from the other corner. 


## Religion

Dragonborn follow the Turian religion centred around [[The Great Dragons]]. 

## Physiology

The average Dragonborn comes out to about six feet in height and an impressively muscular physique. To Dragonborn the growth of muscle comes as natural as drawing breath. Even an untrained Dragonborn would be able to lift a hundred pounds without issue and even carry it for good while. This biological trait allows them to train themselves very quickly in the event that physical strength is required. What takes the average human decades to achieve they can achieve in a year, depending on circumstances even less. This may be due to the immense bone density and incredibly resilient immune system, found in the average Dragonborn. Furthermore their organs are able to produce most vitamins and proteins necessary for them to survive. While without supplementation through diet a Dragonborn would not be considered healthy this abundance of resources allows their bodies to quickly change according to current demands. 

### Reproductive Practises

Dragonborn do not reproduce through physical interaction. Instead if a suitable combination of partners finds themselves they can decide to enable a reproductive mode. In this reproductive mode a psychological connection will be formed with the other parties, through which everyone will construct offspring inside their womb according to the designs transmitted to each other. This mode is usually only possible to reach through extensive interaction between all involved since it requires a deep spiritual connection between each other.  
Once offspring designs have been exchanged each person will incubate the offspring for about four months before the new born is released.

## Name Examples

Since many Dragonborn communities are relatively small, the use of last names is not common place. Usually if a Dragonborn comes from a big city, they will be given an identifier commonly their occupation or something that makes them stand out. It can be seen akin to a "nick name" given to them so that someone in the same community with the same name can be differentiated when talked about or addressed.
