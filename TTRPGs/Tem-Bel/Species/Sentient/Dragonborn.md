## Quick Facts

Dragonborn are imposing figures, due to their hard scales and fire breath. While they may only reach an average height of 6 feet, their bodies can pack enough muscle and organs in there to easily weigh as much as two average humans. Dragonborn have only one biological gender, owing to the fact that they do not need to transfer physical media between each other. Their society is deeply intertwined with the Kobolds. They live in a symbiotic relationship with them, where the Dragonborn will provide hands on labour due to their natural skill in anything physical forming a symbiotic relationship with the more esotherical Kobolds. While Dragonborn may be more generally suited to menial tasks this does not mean, that they are unable to perform great feats in the arts. Infact owing to their hands-on mindedness, Dragonborn artistry is one favoured in many a noble's halls. Some of the world's most renowned painters came from [[Ma'antur]], the country which both Kobolds and Dragonborn equally call their home. Dragonborns may not be the most eloquent of the sentient races, but this does not mean their music can not be rich and intense. A Dragonborn folk song can incorporate many different topics and stylistic choices, ranging from a simple worker's song to pass the time during repetitive labour, to hour long recitals to a love lost or a brave hero. While it may lack the poetic refinement of their Kobold brethren, a Dragonborn bard's performance will still be able to tug on the many strings of a persons existence.

## Culture

Due to the Dragonborns' natural affinity for menial tasks, the Dragonborns' culture is strongly centred around the pride in one's work and a focus around the betterment of the community as a whole. In Turian society there is no "useless" or "undesireable" role, since each member of the community fulfills an important task towards the betterment of the group. This can be observed in the way things are constructed. Whereas in other places people may see a house as just another building needed to provide shelter, or as a place for people to work in, a Turian architect will see each new building as an opportunity to create the best building possible. Turian architecture is built to last. In the older parts of towns there are buildings, centuries old, looking as if they were built yesterday. No Turian home would be considered "complete" until each stone was engraved by the mason creating it, each wooden support be polished and prepared to perfection, and outside as well as inside walls be painted in vibrant colours, depicting stories out of the Great Dragon Mythology or just everyday scenes picked from the time the painting was done.  

Turian society has many different festivals and occasions calling for celebrations. 

### Child birth

The birth of a child is usually cause for the whole village to organise a day long celebration in order to assure the child's continued welfare. As it is believed that if a child's first day on this plane is spent in happiness, the rest of its life will follow this example. In larger cities this custom had to be curtailed somewhat due to the high likelihood of a child being born every day. Instead of the whole town celebrating one child's birthday, it was decided through necessity that parents would form a group of all delivered children that day and invite their kin, friends and neighbours to spent the day together instead. Reason here is that shared happiness confounds and thus should alleviate any bad luck coming from the rest of the town missing the occasion. 

### Harvest Season

At both the beginning and the end of the harvest season, a community regardless of size, will host a day long celebration. This is both in order to thank the Great Dragons for another harvesting season but also in order to celebrate the group's efforts in providing abundant sustenance for everyone. Depending on region and the specific season, this day may see exuberant amounts of wine and bread being consumed, whereas a different region may indulge in mead and pie. Customs vary wildly between each community almost as much as their dialects. 


### Regional Holidays

Due to the largely decentralised religious structure of the [[The Great Dragons|Great Dragon Mythology]] each community has slightly differing days for their religious celebrations. While many share the same days or causes for celebration there is generally speaking no community who aligns one to one with another on when to celebrate what. 



## Language

The Turian language has two major varieties: 
1. Standard Turian (colloquially called "City Turian")
2. Turian Dialect (colloquially called "Viallge Turian")

Standard Turian is the Turian taught in Temple schools and used in official politics, not because it is superior in any way to the Turian dialects but because it is standardised and thus easier for foreigners to learn and makes communication between distant communites easier.  

Turian Dialect is the umbrella term for any of the countless Turian Dialects found among Turian communities. Due to the strong sense of community shared between all Turians, villages, towns and even large cities will have their own dialect. Depending on frequency of exchange with different communities, such dialects may or may not deviate more or less strongly from the Standard Turian or their neighbouring deviations. Generally it can be surmised that a Turian from one corner of the region will have a hard time understanding another Turian coming from the other corner. 


## Religion

Dragonborn follow the Turian religion centred around [[The Great Dragons]].

## Name Examples

Since many Dragonborn communities are relatively small, the use of last names is not common place. Usually if a Dragonborn comes from a big city, they will be given an identifier commonly their occupation or something that makes them stand out. It can be seen akin to a "nick name" given to them so that someone in the same community with the same name can be differentiated when talked about or addressed.
