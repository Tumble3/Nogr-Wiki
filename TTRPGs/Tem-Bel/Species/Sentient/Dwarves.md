## Quick Facts

Vertically challenged compared to their [[Humans|Human]] and [[Elves|Elven]] neighbours the Dwarfs still pose an imposing figure. Built from dense muscle, protected by stone-like skin, sporting grand beards on both genders, they make impressive warriors biologically predisposed for inflicting and enduring violence. Due to this dwarven hired muscle is going for a premium in the underworlds all over the settled world. Reducing the dwarf to a bunch how heartless killers, would do them a disservice though. Even though they are sporting impressive physiques with minimal effort, exactly this trait makes it easier for them to focus on other pursuits. Where the average human warrior needs to train in order to wear their armour for extended periods, a below average dwarf will wear that same armour's weight, their camping supplies and their sibling in arms' supplies as well, without any prior training. This and their massive daily calorie intake allowed the dwarven communities to become excellent chefs. Every noble court prides itself on having dwarven chefs in their kitchens, almost as much if not even more, than mob bosses pride themselves on their dwarven henchmen.

## Cuisine

Dwarven food and drink is well known and both highly respected as well as deeply feared by anyone who knows about it. Due to the dwarven body capable of withstanding extreme punishment the dwarven cuisine has developed a preference for strongly spiced dishes and extremely strong alcohol. It is widely known that the average human will at least incur severe injuries to their digestive organs when eating traditional dwarven cuisine. All alcohol produced on the continent of Nogr can be considered a nerve toxin at best and straight up poison at the worst. Dwarven alcoholic beverages are strong enough to induce mild intoxication to a dwarf after as little as one full glass, classifying them officially as highly toxic to anyone who is not a dwarf. 

## Music

Dwarven music is highly influenced by the binary with which dwarven culture usually is associated. Many artists play with it in their songs, often making fun of it or talking about their own experiences. Others fully lean into it, making ranchy tavern songs singing about violence, food and the imbibement of alcohol or marching songs about how much they miss doing those things while out campaigning. Their music may seem simple on the surface, with easy to remember choruses or repeating lines, but there is often times a lot of subtext in their vocabulary, or they make their songs easy to remember to allow the others to chime in after only a few stanzas. Dwarven musical etiquette is highly communal usually expecting to sing together ranging from a pair up to whole battalions. The act of joining their friends in song is a corner stone of dwarven identity and a show of respect towards friend and foe alike. 


### Musical Etiquette in Fighting

The tradition of joining each other in song even goes so far as to be a part of duelling or brawling etiquette. If two rival gangs decide on a time and place to fight it is expected for them to each bring one song before the battle so that each side may join the other in one of their songs. A side may choose to disregard this tradition, but such a decision will have consequences for the rest of the organisations's existence. Disrespecting proper battle etiquette will put them on the radar of any dwarf not in that group and may even lead to dwarfs of the offending side deserting at the nearest possible chance, to a group known for respecting the rules.   
While war between two armies is usually a larger affair than two gangs brawling in the streets, if the dwarven battalions are numerous enough on both sides or if the generals are either dwarfs themselves or amenable to the tradition both sides will meet before the start of a battle to join each other in song as well. Usually both sides will bring one song to the occasion, but depending on the gravity of the battle or other factors it may be decided to split songs between individual battalions or even smaller battle groups. 


## Name Examples

Similar to human names, dwarven names follow one strict convention: Each first name must be followed by either a matronymic or a patronymic. This would mean that Trodn's kid would be Hagn Trodnsson for a male and Legga Trodnsdottir for a female child. Since it is up to the child to choose which parent they want to honour with their last name, a child does not possess an official last name until it reaches the age of 16, where it is then allowed to choose one officially. Before that moment, it will hold a placeholder last name chosen by its parents.
