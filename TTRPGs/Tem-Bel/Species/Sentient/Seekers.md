## Quick Facts

The Seekers are an artificial near immortal species. They were created by a mysterious entity, they call "The Creator", only to be later abandoned by said entity. Seeker legends claim, that they were created to explore the different planes, record any and all knowledge they could find and bring peace and harmony to any and all that were willing. According to seeker elders until the Creator left, this mission was carried out without troubles, but ever since the Creator vanished, their children, the Seekers, left abandoned and without guidance had to rapidly adapt to this new condition. Those years of transition were understandably rough, with many Seekers straying from the path and loosing themselves in their own logical fallacies. By now there are numerous seeker enclaves, some more some less close to the Creator's vision. But all of them carry the seed of their original intent, to explore the planes and record knowledge. And all of them still connect to the shared trauma of the abandonment felt due to the leave of their creator. Most enclaves still believe that the Creator will return to them, they believe that once they are judged worthy, the Creator will return and lead them to a brighter future. Until that time though, they will be left alone, seeking solace in their community, seeking to replace the familiarity and parental relation now missing, just like their Creator.

## Culture

With their primary prerogative being the collection of knowledge their primary focus lies within the documentation and collection of said knowledge. Apart from that though, they place intense focus on the betterment of their society and any who accept their help. They will use their collective wisdom to decide on the most prudent course of action and then follow suit. There is no first among equals in their community, only the consensus of the group. Since their abandonment, the Seekers lost their ability to reproduce, making the death of a member even more of a harrowing event than usual. Whenever a member dies on their travels and their body cannot be recovered, the community will go into mourning, for the entire year. If their body can be recovered, then it will be reactivated with a new personality matrix, essentially resurrecting them as a newly born child.
