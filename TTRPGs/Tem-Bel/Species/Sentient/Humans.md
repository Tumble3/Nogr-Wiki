## Name Examples

Human names follow one strict convention: Each first name must be followed by either a matronymic or a patronymic. This would mean that Thordr's kid would be Markr Thordrsson for a male and Jutta Thordrsdottir for a female child. Since it is up to the child to choose which parent they want to honour with their last name, a child does not possess an official last name until it reaches the age of 16, where it is then allowed to choose one officially. Before that moment, it will hold a placeholder last name chosen by its parents.
