## Quick Facts

The Lizardfolk, also referred to as Eholit, come form the Theocracy of [[Teholitlan]]. They usually grow up to 1.6 metres tall and can have a wide range of builds depending on their occupations. Eholit have no gender, instead they possess of male and female parts and decide who takes up which role, when producing offspring. Their culture is highly religious and every aspect of their lives revolves around the gods. Due to the immense heat and humidity found in the regions of their homeland, most Eholit do not wear clothes. Since their scales are quite good as a natural armour and their reproductive organs are all on the inside anyway, they can fairly reasonably go without clothing or armour. This does not apply to the priesthood however, they wear specially tailored robes (see [[^|Culture]] for more information). Due to their unwavering fervour, their culture has seen rise to some of the best craftsmen, painters and warriors in history. Eholit are seldom fearful and are fiercely loyal companions once someone has earned their trust.

### Clothing

The average Eholit likely will not be wearing clothes, but warriors may wear ceremonial armour and members of the priesthood will wear robes appropriate to their god and station. 

### Ceremonial Armour

While a self respecting Eholit fighting against the various enemies the community might face will not shame themselves by wearing armour, that same warrior might wear one for ceremonial purposes. If they take part in a ritual to aggrandise the gods or ask for their favour a warrior might wear a black leathery suit. Into this suit will be sewn various bones acquired from the corpses of the person's slain enemies. Each ceremonial armour thus will be highly customised and tell the tale of the warrior's experiences. These armours are not made to protect or be comfortable but rather to be a praise to the individual and the gods which have favoured it. 

### Religious Attire

The priesthood of Eholit society is proud to represent the gods' will and will act and clothe themselves accordingly. Depending on the rank of the individual their robes will be more or less practical, with newer initiates having shorter and less flowing robes and the highest ranked individuals robes which are multiple times longer and wider than their entire bodies.

#### Priests of Qotal

#### Priests of Qelzotal

#### High Priesthood

The High Priesthood have dedicated their lives to one of the gods for long enough to ascend into the highest ranks of Eholit priesthood. Thus instead of wearing to usual long flowing robes of the lower ranks their robes are pure white. Long and billowing, even longer than their lower ranked siblings these robes are neither practical nor useful in any way. Since these priests have dedicated themselves for so long to the gods, they are such masters at their chosen crafts that such impractical clothing hinders them not in the least, instead it shows others that even when hindered by such impractical clothing they perform at masterful levels, showcasing the possible effects when bestowed by the gods' favour. 



### Gender and Sexual Practises

Since all Eholit are of the same gender, there is no real gender in Eholit society. This extends to [[Litan]], the Eholit written language, which does not have any grammatical genders at all. While for explanation purposes an Eholit pairing may be referred to as "female" and "male" this is usually only done to clarify to outsiders who gets pregnant and who impregnates.  
The rules of courtship in Eholit society are fairly lax. Unless someone wants to produce offspring swapping partners is neither taboo nor a problem for anyone involved. Since intercourse produces numerous positive side effects for all involved and since the host body or "female" needs to accept the seed in order to even get pregnant, unwanted pregnancy is never an issue. This does result in a fairly strict code of conduct for future parents. If a pairing decides that they want to produce offspring they will need to undergo several steps in order to become a parentable pairing: 
1. They will go to a temple together and ask the gods for their blessing  
2. They will go to their families and ask them for advice  
3. They will have to prove to the community that they have enough space for children  
4. They will stop swapping partners for, at least, the duration of their courtship  
5. They will conduct a show duel between each other to determine who will execute which role while carrying the offspring and immediately follow through with fertilisation.   
6. All is well and the community celebrates  

While an Eholit couple is required to perform a show match in order to determine who will impregnate and who will get pregnant, this is not a show of dominance between the pairing. Rather it is a show to the community and the gods themselves that both partners are willing and able to defend themselves and their future offspring. This is why usually these duels are fought without hurting the partner (unless agreed upon prior for personal reasons) and why these matches are usually more for show than for showcasing martial prowess. The match has a symbolic factor, reenacting the aftermath of the slaughter which the three Eholit gods commenced in order to form the world the Eholit now inhabit. Furthermore the outcome of the duel can be used to determine who should be the "female" part if both partners have displayed adequate physical form prior to the match. Since the partner with the stronger body is favoured to be the "female", the victor is expected to be impregnated by the weaker defeated "male" part of the coupling. Since Eholit do not birth life young and instead produce an egg, which then incubates itself at home, the stronger partner is usually carrying it, since then the burden of hauling a heavy egg around their insides is less debilitating. Eholit have a special organ in the back of their throat which will release a fertilising residue upon copulation into the mouth of the partner. The partner can then choose to let the residue slide into their stomach for disposal or open the womb canal adjacent to the stomach in order to let themselves be fertilised. Eholit carry their eggs for about two months (with slight variations) which then incubate for another, resulting in an Eholit newborn after three to four months. 


## Language


## Religion

In Eholit society everything revolves around the gods and the gods' favour. The moment a new child is born, the gods will be praised. Parents will beseech them for good fortune and health. Children will grow up surrounded by parents, friends and community members all telling them about how they will need to perform at their best and excel in whatever way possible in order to thank the gods for creating the world. Even when struck with a deadly illness an Eholit will not miss a day or opportunity to praise the gods or ask them for help. The gods are infallible and their divine will may not always be clear but is ultimately focused around making Eholit society stronger and better equipped to handle the jungle's dangers. The Eholit believe in three Gods: Quetzal, Qotal and Qelzotal. The specifics on the religion of the [[Three Gods Pantheon]] can be found in its article but usually depending on an individual's passions they subscribe to one of the three gods as their patron deity, worshipping them first and foremost and dedicating their life to them.
