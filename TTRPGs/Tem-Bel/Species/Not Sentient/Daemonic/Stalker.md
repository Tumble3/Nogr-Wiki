## Quick Overview

If encountered, it is usually a sign for daemonic activity in the region. 
Supposedly hunts using sound.
Looks elf-like enough to be in the uncanny valley when not in close proximity. 


## Visual description

Humanoid in appearance, the Stalker has unnaturally smooth skin, usually coloured a pale white or light grey. They resemble an elf with slightly elongated limbs from afar, showing two arms and legs just that side of too long. Their form is slender and their movements graceful. Scholars compare them to the daemonic equivalent of dancers. Their steps are silent unless they are in a playful mood. Aggressive and cruel by nature, they stalk their prey using their stealth and speed, sometimes toying with them by letting their hard, spiked feet click on the ground, or by scraping their long talon-like fingers over a surface. Most of their prey will never hear anything else, if something at all. Their head has neither eyes nor ears or nose. It is unclear how they perceive the world around them but it is said, that if one is as a corpse, then they *might* not be noticed. Since most people are incapable of stopping their heart at will, scholars have not been able to confirm the claim, that they rely solely on their hearing to locate prey. Still, they are some of the more often encountered daemonic entities due to them being sent out as scouts and assassins usually employed by other, darker entities.


## Background




## Variations

Depending on the daemonic entity that spawned them, the Stalker can have a few variations, most of them though are purely visual.

### The Domain of Wrath

Stalkers from the plain of wraith are rumoured to have a slightly more pink rather than grey skin tone. They are supposed to be lighter in shade and possess a more aggressive hunting style. 

### The Domain of Plague

Stalkers from the Plain of Plague are easy to spot. Lacerations oozing yellow or brown puss cover their bodies, while pustules and infestations cover the rest. Missing the dancer's grace their siblings possess, they instead lumber on unsteady feet towards their quarry. Their bodies exude an odour of rot, commonly associated with a forlorn garden, smelling decay or disease. According to dubious witness accounts they are able to control the strength of the smell at will, concealing it during the hunt and empowering it during a fight. Scholars presume that the Stalker can make use of the stink to further weaken or even incapacitate a victim, in order to allow for an easier fight.  

### The Domain of Lust

Where the Stalker from the domain of Plague is showing rot and decay and the domain of Wraith a tendency for violence, the Stalker of Lust is different. These are most pronounced in the way they hunt. Where the other plains strife for a quick kill, these Stalkers let their victims run or fight regularly, in order to savour their vain hopes for survival or desperate attempts to plea for mercy. Other Stalkers are assumed to be acting out their violent tasks on a more instinctual level, doing their assigned task and moving on, the Stalker from the domain of Lust seems to take joy from the torment they inflict on their victims. They cut their victims slowly in order to let their squeals of pain echo for as long as possible. They hunt them until they die of exhaustion. They let them believe they have a chance at winning in a straight fight only to crush their hopes as brutally as they can. A Stalker from the Domain of Lust is considered to be one of the worst to encounter for the victim. 

### The Domain of Strife

The Domain of Strife is presumed to be the architect of the original Stalker. Employed to sow chaos and mistrust in any and all places their Stalkers are as close to the original vision of a silent assassin as possible. 

### The Domain of Sloth

Scholars are divided on the topic of the Domain of Sloth's Stalker. Some claim, that the Domain of Sloth does not even have its own Stalker variant, while others supposed that it does, but it unchanged to the one coming form the Domain of Strife. It remains to be seen which of the two beliefs turns out to be true. 

### The Domain of Gluttony 

Similar to the Domain of Sloth, the Stalker from the Domain of Gluttony is not a confirmed certainty. Rumours have it that they exist but either nobody is brave enough to claim knowledge about them or nobody has lived long enough to become a witness to their actions. 

### The Domain of Fear


Similar to the Domain of Lust, the Stalker from the Domain of Fear also employs tactics building upon using the inherent anxieties of their target. But rather than prolonging the chase and eventual kill, the Stalker from the Domain of Fear uses fear as a tool, to bring about the death of their victim as fast and cleanly as possible. Fear is the mind killer, and Stalkers from this domain are experts in wielding it as a deadly weapon.
