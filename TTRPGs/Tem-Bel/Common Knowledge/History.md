### Nogrian Imperial Calendar

In theory, every continent and nation uses their own calendar to measure the passing of time. To make generalized timelining easier, the Imperial Standard Calendar (short ISC) is used to standardize historical records. It orients itself around the ascension of the first emperor of Nogr. Before the ascension it is abbreviated as BFA (before first ascension) and after the ascension is abbreviated as AFA (after first ascension).
