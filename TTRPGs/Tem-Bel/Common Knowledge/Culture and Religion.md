### Followers of Althea

The [[Altheans|Followers of Althea]] have [[Althea Homilion]] as their main goddess after her ascension following the crisis in [[Angamarum]]. Their belief is structured after the life which their goddess supposedly lived. Due to Althea's widely known bouts of nudity her followers have decided to adopt this stance as a core tenant of their belief, forsaking any and all clothing unless absolutely necessary. As necessary deemed clothes are backpacks, blankets and medical coverings. Secondly they believe in helping anyone in need. They are most commonly known as missionaries or care workers, doing their best to help the lost and forgotten of society live a better life. This is coincidentally where they find most of their converts, making the Altheans a powerful sect in the lower levels of society.
