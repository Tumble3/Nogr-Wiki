## Quick Facts

The planet of Tem-Bel is located in a binary star system. It orbits between its two suns in an elliptical pattern, making it thus that one sun is always on the decline and another is on the rise. Around the planet float four moons and 17 star constellations can be seen on a clear night's sky.
