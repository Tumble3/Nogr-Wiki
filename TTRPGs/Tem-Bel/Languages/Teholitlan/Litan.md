## Quick Facts



## Grammar


### Syntax

Verb Subject Object
If there are multiple verbs the most important one stands in front.

### Adjective Behaviour

If a Noun is adjectived it needs to be translated as Noun of Adjective-Noun.


### Imperative

Imperative can be dictated with a hiss at the start or end of the sentence.
At the start of the sentence a hiss is used to indicate derision and at the end it is “friendly” Imperative.

### Determiner

This/These can be said by using tsi:k in front of the noun.

### Plural

Can be indicated by using clicks:
Singular(Honourable): Normal
Singular(Dishonourable): ⟨ǀǀǀ⟩-  -⟨ǀǀǀ⟩
Plural (Honourable): ⟨ǀ⟩-
Plural (Dishonourable): -ak⟨ǀ⟩

### Increasing Magnitude

To indicate that something should be more or stronger (like very): ʔ- 
To indicate that something is the most: tɬʔ-

### Tenses

Present: No special marking
Past (positive): mo:⟨ǀǀ⟩ta- 
Past (Negative): -mo:⟨ǀǀ⟩ta
Close future(less than or up to a month): ma:⟨ǀǀ⟩ta-
Far future(more than a month): - ma:⟨ǀǀ⟩ta
Continuity: ⟨ǀǀ⟩kata-

#### Talking about the dead:

If someone recently died: mo:⟨ǀǀ⟩ta-
If someone died long ago: mo:⟨ǀ⟩a-
If someone is going to die soon: -mo:⟨ǀǀ⟩ta
If you swear that someone shall die at some point: -mo:⟨ǀ⟩a

### Stress

Stress is normally on the tense fix but in present it is on the honorific instead if there is no click sound in the word itself.

### Negation

Happens while speaking the sentence with a titled head.

### Politeness

If you want to be rude or polite you either use the honourable or dishonourable tenses, cases and vocabulary paired with the corresponding scent marking. Dishonourable should be shown by secreting a smell of superiority or confidence while Honourable should be displayed by the smell of either fear or respect (depending on the entity in question)

### Relative Structures

Relative Structures are indicated by a hiss with a ts click at the end of the relativising word.
