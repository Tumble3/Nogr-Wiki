### Numerals

Nogrian numerals follow a simple rule. The numbers one to twelve are the base numerals. These then get added on top of the highest denomination of twelve since two Nogrian hands have space for twelve numerals.  Which would mean that 13=12+1, 24= 2\*12, 119= 9\*12+11 and so on. Since the numbers 6, 60 and 3600 are all related to the Nogrian currency denominations, **they do not follow this rule**. Instead they follow the names of the currency they represent.
