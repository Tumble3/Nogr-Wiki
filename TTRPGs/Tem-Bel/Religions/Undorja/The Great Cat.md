## Quick Facts


The belief in The Great Cat is a monotheistic belief originating from the Dorian planes. It is centred around the idea that the world and its inhabitants were created in the image of The Great Cat. A primordial being gifted with immense power, wisdom and age. While it is unclear whence it came or how it spawned, scholars believe that in its infinite wisdom and power it decided to bring this world into being. May that desire have come from boredom or a greater plan, it matters not to the average follower. Instead a follower is expected to follow the teachings and core beliefs of The Great Cat, 

## Structure

The Temple of The Great Cat follows a flat leadership structure. Depending on your individual accomplishments during your lifetime your opinion's weight may change, thus the hierarchy depends on the issue at hand. The only differentiating aspect between a regular citizen and a priest would be the formal education received by a priest, which the regular citizen would not have. 


## Values

The belief in The Great Cat follows a strict rule based schema. The first are the five pillars of the core belief structure: 
1. Mirènne (Security of belief): This pillar represents the individual's ability to take pride in their belief and openly declare themselves a follower of The Great Cat when questioned. 
2. Acuteil (Mindfulness): This pillar represents the individual's responsibility towards living responsibly. A follower of The Great Cat has to keep in mind, that The Great Cat has gifted them the ability to speak, coordinate and think rationally. These perks come with the stipulation that a follower of The Great Cat is expected to be empathetic, caring and selfless, so that they may use the gift which The Great Cat bestowed upon them, to make the creation of The Great Cat a good place and honour The Great Cat with appreciation of its great gifts. 
3. Julènne (Respecting the dead): This pillar represents the inherent need to respect the dead, regardless of species, age, social standing or familiar standing. This pillar will be exercised by any practitioner by properly giving a corpse its burial in the Luoir tu'jaime (Maw of Hunger). 
4. Maniel (Belief in the true deity): A follower of The Great Cat may encounter different interpretations of The Great Cat's gift and belief. While such followers may be considered "astray" so lang as they do not violate any of the values of The Great Cat they may be considered siblings in faith, even if they may see themselves as different. As long as a follower of The Great Cat knows in their heart that there is only The Great Cat and that within its creation others may decide follow its teachings in a different way, the follower is still in concert with their maker. 
5. Litaiènne (Study if scipture): This pillar requires that a follower of The Great Cat has to read and study the holy scriptures and if necessary teach them to other followers as well. Even if the follower is not a priest, the follower should know the holy texts by heart so that they may guide their decisions in life.
