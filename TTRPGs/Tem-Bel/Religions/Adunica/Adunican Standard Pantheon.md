## Quick Facts

The Adunican pantheon is largely influenced by the landscape it stems from. The harsh volcanic island of Adunica has instilled in its population the belief in two main gods. Richildis, the god of fire, steel and craftsmanship and Candrec god of commerce, exploration and sailing. Due to the relative androgyny of Adunican physiology, the imagery surrounding the gods usually depicts them as ambiguous of gender. Since Adunican physiology and society has no concept or need for gender, the gods too are free of such constraints. 
It is largely believed that Candrec brought the first Adunican sprout to the Island through the power of her tides. There it was up to Richildis to nurture that first sprout into growing to be the first Adunican. Valaric supposedly is the progenitor of all Adunicans, making it possible for each and every one of them to trace their ancestry back to them in theory. Due to the effective nonsenescence of the Adunican race, they operate on a timescale barely comprehensible to the average outsider, making the tracing of early Adunican society all the more difficult. Even so, the belief in Valaric as the first Adunican is strongly rooted in Adunican society. 
Richildis is one half of the Adunican pantheon. Whenever the massive volcano on Adunica erupts, it is imperative to give praise for Richildis. While Richildis can be incredibly destructive through the eruptions and subsequent flooding of tunnels, it is that same destruction which brings the necessary nutritious warmth that Adunican society needs to thrive and expand. Since such erupts usually also carry new resources to the surface Richildis is especially revered by artists and artisans alike. Without the regular "Gifts of Richildis" the numerous artificers, scientists, artists and craftspeople of Adunica would struggle to keep their enormous industrial throughput going. It is often thought, that Richildis is, in the eyes of an Adunican, quite temperamental. Seeing the eruptions as expressions of dissatisfaction or signs of affection, since depending on the damage or gifted resources, Richildis' intent would be divined through careful assessment. Such direct displays of emotion are rare even among inter Adunican relations, and as such seen as the temperaments of a powerful god, able to destroy the world if not extremely careful, as such the eruptions are understood as the minimum possible extent the god is capable of, due to their immense possible power.
Candrec, the god of commerce, exploration and sailing, is credited as the model after which Adunican personalities had been formed. Compared to the almost cataclysmic eruptions of Richildis' volcano, the sea always seemed composed, cooling down the deadly hot lava in an instant. Thus, Adunicans strove to model themselves after Candrec's endless patience and ability to control their impulses. While Candrec is seen as the god responsible for the safe passage of ships and the control of Richildis' temperament, Candrec is more often invoked in matters of careful diplomacy or situations where it pays to keep a cool head. Most sailors will still pray to Candrec to give them a safe passage, but they will put more of their time towards praising Richildis, since it was them who provided the resources to create the ship in the first place, and who could destroy everything the sailors know and love, if their appreciation would be found lacking. This preferential treatment, while deemed unjust by some theologians, is the natural consequence of immensely powerful beings, whose motives are beyond the understanding of any carnal being, coexisting with each other.
