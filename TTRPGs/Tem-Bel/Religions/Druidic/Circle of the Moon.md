## Structure



## Values

The circle of the moon is known for practising a semi-strict diet of fruit and vegetables, with only freely given animal produce or hunted meat if one population is threatening the region. 
They value animal life as much as any and all life, which influences their choices in habitat, diet and life style. 
Members from the circle of the moon live with minimal impact to plant and animal life, barely disrupting the natural flow around them with their communities. 
Wisdom and Knowledge about nature are essential, with a specific focus on animals. 


## Daily life

The daily life of a circle of the moon druid will boil down to their occupation. 
Children will be sent to schools or vocational supervisors which will give them both theoretical and practical lessons concerning life with in the community and the surrounding landscape. They will learn to speak with animals and sometimes even with plants. They will be experts on the local fauna with a vast knowledge on where, when and why a certain animal will be. 
Adults usually can be put into two groups: 
1. Communal tenders
2. Rangers

The communal tenders will stay in the community's boundaries and care for the children, buildings and day to day proceedings of life withing the premises. They will be teachers, arborists or cooks, among many other professions. Communal tenders work their magic around the homestead, making sure that the next generation is taught and that the homes and inhabitants are cared for. 

Rangers live closer to nature than most other  sentient non-druid creatures. They stalk the lands surrounding the community, looking out for the many different groups of animals and keeping tabs on their growth and well being. They are tasked with defending the lands from the city dwelling folk and keeping the balance of nature in check. 

## Deities

The circles of the moon do not adhere to one persistent deity. Most often one will find that a particular community follows one or two distinct beliefs, but there is no overarching deity to represent the circles of moon as a whole. 
Most common deities are:
- [[Ulthra]]
- [[Wodenia]]
- [[Altheans]]


## Follower restrictions

As long as members adhere to the core values and rules of the community, there are no restrictions on who can possibly join them.
