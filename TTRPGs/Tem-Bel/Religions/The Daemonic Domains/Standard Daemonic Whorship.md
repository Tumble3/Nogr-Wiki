## Quick Facts

One of the planes of existence are the so-called demonic planes. It is believed that they exist between space and time, thus anyone who tries entering them risks not only their personal livelihood but also might not return into their own timeline or back to the place from which they had entered. All of the demonic planes share a few common traits among each other. First, all of them are an exemplary showcase of the deity they belong to. Second, they are extremely hazardous for demons to live in, even worse for anything or anyone else. Third, even if one enters and leaves, one can never be sure to ever be free of the corrupting influence such a stay might have had.
