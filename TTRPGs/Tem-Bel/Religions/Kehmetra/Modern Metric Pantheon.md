## Quick Facts

The people of modern day Kehmetra believe in natural spirits instead of any specific gods. In their minds the world is run by the spirit of the Sea and their partner, the spirit of the Land. These two spirits have many children all standing for different aspects of life. These child spirits are known for their pranks and unreliability, causing a person on one day to produce the finest masterwork every seen and on the next day to fail in a basic task. Their fickleness is legendary and hard to control, but it is widely accepted that if one tries their best, that it is in the hands of the spirits to deign their work a success or failure.  Below is a list of some of the most commonly found spirits, but in Kehmetran Society every concept is inhabited by a spirit which required proper respect in order to be manipulated by any Kehmetran.
