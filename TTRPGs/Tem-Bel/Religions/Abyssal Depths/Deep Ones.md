## Quick Facts

Among the dwellers in the Abyssal Depths there are two main groups of believers. The believers in the Deep Ones follow the old ways of the region. In their belief there are ancient and powerful entities, hidden deep beneath the surface of the planet. According to their legends the crust of the planet is more akin to a system of massive caves, tunnelling deep into the earth. Far below the surface thus the Deep Ones are believed to lie. Some may sleep, others may hunt and further more some may just wait. The followers of the Deep Ones believe that if these entities were to one day leave their burrows and return to the above world, their great power and otherworldly perceptions would mean death and destruction for anything currently living here. This is why they fiercely guard their holy grounds, fearing the stir of their elder gods, and why they conduct their rituals without exception. Since for them it is their holy duty to protect the living and the dead from the rise of their, not malignant, but alien and thus either uncaring or incomprehensible gods.
