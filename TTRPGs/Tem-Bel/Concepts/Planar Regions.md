# Quick Facts


There are many different planes which are mostly inaccessible to the general populace. These planes are split between different daemonic realms, magical planes and pocket dimensions. Usually the laws of nature known in the material plane are either loosely followed or disregarded entirely, making traversal for the unaccustomed not only dangerous but depending on the whims of the plane even near impossible.
