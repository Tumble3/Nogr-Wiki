Most living beings live on one shared plane. Most scholars call it the material plane because most matter and almost all things that one can interact with can be found on there. Now magically gifted people can as well as anyone else influence this material plane but these people can also access the immaterial or esotherical plane. Now here it becomes interesting, the immaterial plane can be considered like an abstraction of the material plane. If something exists in the material plane then its immaterial representation can also be found in the immaterial plane. Now a properly trained (or just plain lucky) person can manipulate these representations in a way that transforms the properties or attributes of an object or a space. But this is normally extremely taxing for the mind and body in question. Most known mages can only tap into the power of the immaterial plane a set amount before their body needs to rest but there where many who have tried and (for the most part) failed to overcome their limitations. Often with very dire consequences to either their health or the health of the ones sourrounding them.
