## My day

First, I wake up. Then, I get dressed. I walk to the temple. I do not ride a monitor. I like to go to the temple. It rains. I do not like rain. I eat lunch. I eat a sandwich and an apple.

I play outside. I like to play. I read a book. I like to read books. I walk home. I do not like walking home. My parent cooks soup for dinner. The soup is hot. Then, I go to bed. I do not like to go to bed.


## My family at home

My family lives in a nice house. It’s simple but pretty. It has a large garden. I like to work in the garden but my sibling hates to work in the garden. They prefer to read. They read in the morning, in the afternoon and at night.

I give all of the vegetables to my parents. They like to cook in our small kitchen. I eat any vegetable but my sibling eats only a few.

My family always eats breakfast and dinner together. We talk. We laugh. Then my sibling washes the dishes.

At night one of my parents likes to listen to music. The other works on their clay works. I read my favourite book. And my sibling reads to. Soon we go to bed. My parents go to bed late but my sibling and I go to bed early. I’m ready to go to sleep but my sibling wants to keep reading.


## The House

My neighbours, Cutlataz and Elzataq have two children. Their names are Luntaq and Coatlan.

They live in a house. They have a living room. They work on knit-work in the living room. One parents cooks food in the kitchen. They eat in the dining room. The house has two bedrooms. They sleep in the bedrooms. They keep their clothes in the closet. There is one bathroom. The house has a garden. Luntaq and Coatlan play in the garden.
