## Quick Facts

Eholit liturgical music is mainly focused around a slowly chanted text, escorted by few or none musical instruments, relying strongly on the voices of the priests and the echo of the temples. It draws from many different religious topics or stories aiming to bring the glory of the gods and their creations to the people. 


## Structure

A stanza is made up from multiple verses. It starts with an introduction, telling the listener who is being adressed. Then the first chorus starts with "Their resplendent glory". This chorus is fixed and has to be repeated between verses. Then the second part may come, talking about the great deed for which the entity is praised. Then another chorus and the stanza is finished.
