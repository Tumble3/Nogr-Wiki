## Nobility


## Clerical


## Magic Users


Since magic users are most often state funded and in high demand, they wear medium to high quality clothing representing their individual backgrounds. Depending on the situation they adapt their outfits, for example would a wizard going to a noble's ball, wear their Special Occasion Robes, while they would probably opt for a more practical outfit if going out into the wilderness. 


### Wizards

Wizards are discovered fairly young and usually spend their early years at the mages college in [[Romandar]]. Due to their high social status they would be clad in some of the higher quality garments available to the college. They would usually have at least three possible outfits to choose from: 
- Day to day outfit 
- Special occasion outfit
- Exploration/Outdoors outfit

The day to day outfit would be something warm first and foremost. Nogrian weather is not kind to the ill-prepared, so the day to day outfit would be made up from multiple layers offering different levels of heat retention and water absorption. The outermost layer is usually a cloak made of heavy furs or thick wool. Usually also depicting either their family crest or the emblem of the specific school they study under. Colours can range from anything but usually focus on the colours that represent the current government, sponsoring their college. Under the cloak there is usually a woollen vest worn by both female and male students. Under the vest is usually a woollen button-down shirt and woollen pants. The shoes are usually thick boots, with hard soles, so that they make not only a thumping noise but also clack, thus announcing the wizards arrival to the masses. Usually a wizard also has at least one pair of day to day gloves, either made from pelt or wool. Depending on personal preferences and availability, they can also choose to wear a hood or a felt hat to protect their heads from the biting winds. It is common to wear multiple layers of foot protection. First come the wrappings, which are essentially long woollen wraps, wrapped around the naked foot, then comes a light woollen sock, over which then a thick and heavy woollen sock is drawn. This would allow the user to adjust the warmth of their feet when entering or leaving buildings, reducing the accumulation of sweat and other moisture, when staying indoors for prolonged periods. 

The special occasion outfit, would be something made of the highest quality material available to the state. This outfit is reserved for special occasions. When a new emperor is crowned, the college is expected to attend in their special occasion outfits for example. Most often it comes down to current trends and the preferences of the person. Often wizards choose either long dresses or extravagant talar-like outfits. Colours can range from anything that is easily available at the market but usually concentrate on the college's or the government's colours. 

Exploration/Outdoors outfits are usually very streamlined. Designed for maximum efficiency and safety. Incorporating either very light armour or many pockets and straps to reduce backpack usage and allow for quick access to spell books or ingredients. Usually these garments are predominantly made from felted leathers allowing for warm but robust clothing. Since the actual dress up, is entirely dependant on the person's choices and the adventure they are about to embark on, these outfits are highly customised without any clear trends.
