## Quick Facts

The only artificially built city on the continent of [[Tem-Bel/TTRPGs/Tem-Bel/Continents/Nogr|Nogr]], the city of Migdor once housed thousands of inhabitants. Commissioned by the great [[Emperor Tarell I.]], it was supposed to show the great feats in architecture, magic and agriculture the new [[Empire of Nogr]] was capable of. At first it was a great success, the first three floors of the subterranean city located in the [[Sornaldr Mountains]] were built in less than eight years. A marvellous feat of engineering for the time. Built into one of the tallest mountains the ridge had to offer it provided countless amounts of raw materials to build with all over the empire. Precious metals, gems or expertly hewn stone, once the artisans got set up, all came flooding into the empire. The newly established city prospered and expanded ever deeper into the mountain. If official claims are to be believed the furthest the city stretched was twenty seven fully built floors and one more in construction. Scholars now believe that if [[Emperor Tarell I.]] had lived longer, the city might have reached a now unimaginable amount of inhabitants and prosperity. Due to the tumultuous aftermath of the emperor's death the city soon found its resources focused around its defence from neighbouring warlords, thus early on stopping expansion efforts entirely. Due to its location inside a tall peak encircled by a massive mountain range and only possessing one entrance, Migdor rarely came under direct assault. Attackers usually choosing to conduct diplomacy or subterfuge in order to capture the mostly self reliant fortress city. Near the end of the [[Xerzes]] catastrophe Migdor was destroyed by a magical plague brought forth by the demons with whom [[Xerzes]] had consorted. To this day, the ruins of Migdor are magically poisoned, making it difficult for even the strongest of wizards to penetrate deeply into its mouldy and rotten insides.
