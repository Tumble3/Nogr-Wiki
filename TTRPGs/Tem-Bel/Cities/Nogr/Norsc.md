## Quick Facts

Norsc is the historical and cultural capital of the Nogrian State. Its oldest foundations date it to being one of the first settlements of the refugees settling the Nogrian continent referred to as [[Tem-Bel/TTRPGs/Tem-Bel/Calendars and Events/Nogr|Nogr]]. 


## Early history

Legends and excavations place the founding of the city between 3,000 and 2,100 BFA-ISC. Scholars place it as one of the first three major population centres of the early Nogrian people. While gnomish legends tell of a city long before Norsc could have existed, which supposedly stood where the modern Norsc stands, Nogrian Scholars do not believe these to be true.
