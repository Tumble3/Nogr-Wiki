## Quick Facts

The homeland of the Dragonborn and Kobolds is one plagued by heat and droughts in summer, but blessed by mild and bountiful winters. Where Metric life can year round thrive along the coast, Turian life experiences the delights of sunny and warm days year round. Summer is the only season Turian's can't engage in agriculture, since the sweltering heat makes it impossible for most plant life to survive the growing stage unless sheltered and cared for.
