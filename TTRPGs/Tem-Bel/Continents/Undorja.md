## Cultures

The vast and fertile savannahs of Undorja have spawned two distinct cultures. The anthropomorphic feline culture of Tabaxi and Leonins and the winged, flying culture of the Aarakocra. While they may share a common continent, their cultures have developed asynchronous to each other, thus creating two distinct ones with little overlap. 

### Tabaxi and Leonin

The Tabaxi and Leonin are two genetic ends of the same ancestor. Due to their strong relatedness, their every day lives are heavily intertwined. Both races have a strong sense of community. Usually if at all possible they will do things as a group. They don't have to converse while doing their tasks, but if possible a member of the community will work with at least one other in the vicinity. This fosters a great communal spirit between individuals and has moved their society as a whole to see bonds between members as sacred. It is important to keep in mind, that while the community is the most important aspect in any individual's life, the community will never subsume them. The rarely occurring grievances of one, will never be ignored by the many. This has also caused their societal structure to be highly fluid. The concepts of monogamy or personal possessions are as foreign to them as the idea of sailing the high seas. Usually, a family will consist of a group of partners living with their offspring and sharing the tasks of feeding, cleaning and working to the best of everyone's ability. While there are two biological genders which need to work together to produce offspring, in society itself members do not care about a partner's biological gender. As long as everyone is well and content, people are free to choose their partners. The same goes for private property. The concept of owning something that nobody else can have access to is thus far unknown. In the community there is a general sense of respect towards any creation, be that food, a tool or art, which allows the community to trust each member to treat anything they use with care and reverence. 

### Aarakocra
