## Quick Facts

The continent of Kehmetra is the southernmost continent. Due to its proximity to the equator it is also the warmest continent by now. It is widely accepted as fact, that some environmental change caused the continent to become a mostly desolate wasteland. Because of this the original inhabitants
are no longer alive and have either fled or perished due to the quickly rising inhospitality of their homeland. The only people coming from there now are risen undead, people that lived in the lush and green continent of ancient Kehmetra but have arisen anew due to ~~redacted~~ and now need to find a new purpose in their semi-eternal unlife.


## Geography

The hot and dry deserts of Kehmetra can let one forget about its lush and temperate history. For many centuries its deserts were endless fields filled to the brim with rich crops or adjacent to massive forests. But after centuries of paradise its inhabitants started to realise that the temperature started to rise. Over the next three decades the whole continent transformed from a lush green to a sickly brown and finally into the golden shining sands one can see today.

The whole continent is part of an atoll like structure where smaller landmasses encircle the main landmass. Each of these islands has one large mountain in its middle and it is widely accepted that these islands must have been created through volcanic activity. The main continent does support this hypothesis as it too has a massive ridge running through the middle of its land and it is claimed by the former and current inhabitants that these mountains once had many obsidian veins in them. Exploration of these more inland parts of the islands is difficult however, due to the reawakening of long dead monarchial dynasties. These queens of old now endlessly engage each other in an endless war for dominance. None of them accept that their death meant that they loose their authority or power, instead each of them now seeks to reclaim their god given right to rule. No one really knows why the long dead queens have resurfaced after centuries of deathly quiet but everyone now accepts that traversing the deadly sands is now not only perilous due to their sheer inhospitality but also due to countless battles happening everywhere, between dead queens vying for power. Still there are those brave or foolish adventurers which dare to venture into these sands to search long abandoned temples or graves in order to find legendary artifacts murmured to have been produced by the queens of the old ages.

### Ancient Metric Remnants

Considering the long and rich history of the Kehmetran people, one would suspect them to be a prideful and accomplished group. Contrary to that expectation, modern Metric society is built on deep introspection and a healthy dose of scepticism towards authority and magic.  
In ancient Kehmetra the 6 eras of God-Queens lived magically prolonged lives, guiding their followers for centuries with an iron fist. It was not customary for anyone beyond the immediate relatives of the actively reigning queen to question the current status, which meant that the Queen's decisions were rarely considered fallible or outright possible to be questioned. While this resulted in an extremely efficient and corruption light form of administration and governance, it also was cause for the eventual decline of the Ancient Metric Empire. This collapse and the subsequent mass exodus of the Metric population has brought Metric genes to the numerous shores of Tem-Bel's many continents and introduced many of the other races to the more formal aspects of magic. The few communities which had remained on Kehmetra are the predecessors of the modern Metric people.  

Modern Metric life is marred by a strong sense of egalitarianism and democracy. Having learnt from the mistakes of the past, they now try their utmost to prevent anything like that to happen again.   

Constantly reminded of the mistakes their ancestors had made, Metric cities and villages are built almost exclusively on the shores of the main land mass. Apart from the harsh desserts, almost scorching any exposed skin in a matter of hours, the further one travels into the dune seas of Kehmetra the higher the risk of meeting the unfriendly ancestors, marching through once verdant greenery, which is now reduced to sand and wind. While not completely without independent thought, these roaming legions of skeletal warriors follow their undead goddesses with unquestionable loyalty. While their empires as the queens knew them are long gone, to them, it matters little. Reduced to regal skeletons themselves, they fight fruitlessly against their older and younger sisters in an effort to establish their once held splendour anew. This results in battles of immense sizes, with more often than not three or more armies involved. Said armies fight for ever shifting borders, between ancient and forgotten ruins, showing the long-lost greatness, their architects had tried to capture, even after so many centuries of decay. Because of these ever shifting borders and the constantly shifting but never tilting balance of power between the six undead empresses, exploration of these ruins is essentially impossible. Even if one were to somehow get past the endlessly patrolling armies, past the countless advancing or retreating legions into one of these ancient structures, one would still be in grave danger. While these structures were built to last, they are the objects of frequent sieges and skirmishes, housing many guerilla troops, expertly trained in stealth, reconnaissance and silent death, as well as hiding some of the smaller legions until their dead have risen again. This is why the balance of power will never favour any of the six queens. It will happen that one queen will win a major victory over one or more of the others, but before she can really gain an advantage either, before another queen stops her from advancing or the soldiers slain on the battlefield rise up and attack her troops from behind. This has prompted any queen to adopt an incredibly patient approach to warfare. Since they do not need to fear death, neither from old age nor from other corporeal causes, they can make sure to be endlessly patient and wait for that one perfect moment until the end of time if necessary.
