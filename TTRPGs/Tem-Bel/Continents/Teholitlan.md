## Quick Facts

Hailing from a long stretching continent drenched in moist jungles or endless plains and steppes it is from here that two great civilizations emerged. On the southern side it were the warlike eholit which led their zealous people against the northern centaurs of the great plains as well as other eholit clans. The eholit are fiercely loyal to their clans and their priests and build massive temples to honour their bloodthirsty gods with ritual sacrifices and ceremonial combat. The centaurs are a more nomadic people inhabiting the colder endless plains of the northern part of the continent. They have a mostly oral history of struggles between different family ventures which
also means that they do not have much of an extensive history since dead historians canâ€™t tell their stories to anyone which is an event that happened a lot due to their innate will to dominate others.


## Geography

The continent of Teholitlan is a vast landmass on the eastern side of the globe. It is split between the luscious and humid jungles of the country Teholitlan and the arid steppes of the nomadic tribes in the north.

In the humid jungles of Teholitlan there are numerous watery plants and a massive array of hostile flora and fauna. Neither plants nor animals welcome intruders with open arms. Almost all the animals have either poisonous fangs, needles or spit attacks, which can attack everything from the nervous system to melting one's skin off. With such dangerous animals it seems like the plant life needed to adapt, which is what one will experience there in full force. Flesh eating fungi, acidic spores and sticky leaves are just some of the ways that the flora has adapted to the already toxic conditions in it's dense jungles. Only few lonely mountains are interspersed among the unending undergrowth and among these, endless caves filled to the brim with obsidian and flint stone can easily be accessed by anyone brave enough to endure their inhabitants. Recently a new kind of danger has come to the surface. Fleshy forests akin to a butchers shop have started to emerge. With a host of new deformed creatures to boot. Many locals suspect some kind of demonic influence but are not yet sure as to how such a thing could happen. 

In the northern half of the continent roaming bands of centaur tribes can be encountered if one is unlucky enough to be found by them. These lands are mostly flat with grasses as tall as most dwarves and trees few and far between. The howling winds need to be reckoned with as these can pick up quite some force in the otherwise resistance sparse landscape. Due to the aggressive and extremely territorial nomadic tribes not many explorers or scientists have been able to document much of these lands and there is still a largely unknown portion which will need a well funded expedition, if there is any hope of documenting to be had.
