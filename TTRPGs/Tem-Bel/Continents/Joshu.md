## Quick Facts

The far away archipelago of Joshu can be found in the far reaches of the western parts of the world. It is a place of frequent storms pelting the land with hard rain during spring and autumn or snow during the winter months, while the summers are known to be humid and hot. This place is the home of the Nagon. A proud people whose culture finds it’s foundations on the basis of philosophy, honour and kinship. They value the circle of life in all facets of day to day proceedings, putting an intense
focus on physical and mental improvements and a cooperative approach to living with nature and each other. This communal approach to life also reflects itself in their political structure, which is structured highly independent on a macro level but tight-knit on the interpersonal plane. Every community has their own council of wise people, with each council made up of an appropriately sized amount of seats.
The amount of seats is dependent on the decision the community made for themselves and usually fluctuates with the amount of people they consider eligible. Each Nagon is raised with the belief that each object or creature is precious and important, be it an ant or one of the wisest Nagon who has ever lived. All are equally important and contribute to the world in their own way. This belief is what they
call ”Juzon mao ni go” or ”Peace of the Twelve” Every member of a community is pushed towards fulfilling the twelve ascensions roughly categorized in four regions:

• Independence
	– Being able to be self-sufficient
	– Work on yourself for the betterment of all
	– Honour and respect yourself and others
• Lifestyle
	– Physical fitness and development of skills
	– Social gatherings to foster communal spirit, teach and learn
	– Fashion as an expression of one’s own experiences and knowledge, combining different styles and colours to tell their life’s story
• Mindset
	– Adventure and experiences for personal development
	– Mindfulness and reflection to prepare and deal with past and future situations
	– Mentorship for others and thus growth for one self
• Interpersonal relationships
	– Inclusivity through respect and openness
	– Conflict resolution through patience and adherence to the core tenants of the community
	– Understand someone else first before passing judgement

## Geography


The region of Joshu is a complex network of islands in a wide archipelago and home to the Nagon. These islands experience intense weather ranges, from massive rain seasons to hot and humid summers to bitingly cold winters. The islands are volcanic in nature with many housing active if mostly harmless volcanoes. Due to this volcanic activity most islands have at least one tall mountain on them and some of the most fertile land hitherto seen anywhere. Built on these islands are harbour cities of varying size and the further inland you go the more untamed nature becomes. The Nagon don't usually set foot further inland other than to erect small way-shrines on the way to places of exceptional natural beauty or danger.
