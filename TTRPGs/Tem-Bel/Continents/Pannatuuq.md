## Quick Facts

Hailing from the northernmost parts of the planet come the people of Pannatuuq. These mostly pacifistic spiritlike people of the water and ice have braved the cold winds of the ice sheets for centuries and developed a strong sense of community within themselves which has sadly made them weary of outsiders. even then they have a caste system by which they order their society into three bodies.
The Rulers, the Explorers and the Commoners. While one is assigned a caste at birth it is possible to attain great prestige regardless of their caste since they hold a strong belief that everyone is born for some reason or another.


## Geography

The endless ice sheets of the northernmost part of the world and its hardy inhabitants call these lands Panatuq. It is a land of ice and snow interpsersed with freezigly cold water bodies. Nothing really grows up there and the natives of Panatuq have adapted to it with resilient stoicism. With a almost completely meat based diet one can only find edible corral or sea grass if one does not want to eat meats. There are only glaciers in place of mountains or hills and one must always be careful when traversing the sheets as not all of them are as sturdy as they seem and a single misstep can be detrimental to ones health.
