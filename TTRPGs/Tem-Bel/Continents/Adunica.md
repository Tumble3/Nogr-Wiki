## Quick Facts



## Geography

The harsh island of Adunica is comparatively small for a racial home world. The whole island is centred around the metallic and rocky outcroppings of one enormous vulcano. Do to the vulcano's age the whole island is one giant net of vulcanic tunnels, rich in both metals as well as stones. The regular seismic activity makes permanent structures difficult to construct, since at any point a previously habitable tunnel could get flooded anew with lava or a seismic tremor could cause brittle buildings to collapse. Because of this, Orcish society had to adapt early on to living in a spartan environment using the heat of the volcano for sustenance and the metal for building and crafting anything they might need.

Adunica is a harsh environment to live in. Sulfur laden air makes it difficult for most life forms to breathe. The stony, very metallic ground is impossible for plant life to use, forcing visitors to bring vast amounts of rations, when visiting.  
Still Adunican society is very welcoming towards outsiders. While to most the average Adunican can seem to be as much of a stone emotionally as their island, Adunican society is highly nuanced in their signs of affection. Most home stuck Adunicans need specialized training to interact with the other species, since even just a slight twitch of an eyebrow would otherwise be interpreted as a massive sign of dissatisfaction or affection, depending on the context. In Adunican society, the average individual's interaction with another is deeply layered. Due to their plant based nature, individuals have many ways in which they can show emotions. Most commonly, there are three ways that an individual can communicate their emotional status. First, there is body language. The most obvious and direct way to communicate to another being how they feel is by physically moving their body parts. This can range from anything between shifting their weight slightly towards or away from their counterparts all the way up to physical touch. Usually, physical touch is reserved to an Adunican's most trusted person. If an Adunican accepts the physical connection with another, it is a sign of not only deep emotional and personal trust but also the exultation of the two's relationship. Such instances where an Adunican touches another individual are so rare and intimate that usually none other than the two engaged individuals are privy to the exchange. Most Adunican couples do not have their first physical connection before their first shared millennium.  
Due to their long-lived lives and emotional restraint compared to other species, Adunicans are rarely seen in military functions unless pressed to do so. Even then, they are as feared as they are respected, through their ability to remain calm even under pressure, and their ability to analyse a combat situation with a detached and calculating mind.
